# 🚀 QA Process Improvements & Exploratory Testing Approach

## 🛠️ If I Joined as the First QA Hire at Linq...

### 1. **Implement Backend Rate Limiting & Bot Protection**
Right now, the contact exchange API allows unlimited, unauthenticated requests. I would work with the backend team to:
- Add rate limiting (e.g., 5 submissions/min/IP)
- Introduce CAPTCHA or invisible reCAPTCHA
- Use honeypot fields to detect bots

**Why it matters**: Prevents abuse, spam, and potential data scraping at scale.

### 2. **Introduce Automated Regression Checks for Critical Flows**
I would build a basic automation suite (using Playwright or Cypress) to cover:
- Contact form submission
- Public profile viewing
- Contact download
- Basic validations (input, success messages)

**Why it matters**: Ensures future releases don’t silently break core features.

---

### 3. **Establish Clear Bug Reporting & Reproduction Standards**
QA reports should be:
- Reproducible (exact steps + environment)
- Prioritized by severity
- Linked to relevant logs or screenshots

I'd help set up templates for bugs and test cases, and coach the team on what good QA documentation looks like.

**Why it matters**: Developers can fix issues faster when bugs are clear and traceable.

## 🔍 My Approach to Exploratory Testing

I treat exploratory testing like detective work. I start with the **user journey**, asking:

- What’s the **core value** this feature delivers?
- What could go wrong? (UX, logic, security, edge cases)
- Can this be abused or misused?

I test both the **expected path** and **weird edge cases** — like submitting long names, using emojis, rapid repeat actions, and trying to break validation logic. I also inspect the **API layer** and developer console to uncover silent failures or poor handling of errors.

Finally, I take notes as I go so I can turn my exploration into structured test cases and bug reports afterward.

📌 I’d bring a balance of structure + curiosity to Linq’s QA efforts from day one.
